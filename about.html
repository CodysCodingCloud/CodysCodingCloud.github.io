						<p>
							I am a full-stack engineer who advanced my web development skills
							through Fullstack Academy. In my previous life, I filled my days
							by working with families focused on ensuring their children's
							prosperity. Although I am leaving the social work industry for the
							technology sector, I am still proud of my years of service where I
							made hard decisions for the families I worked with to ensure
							long-term goals. I have assisted families in gaining confidence in
							themselves to become the family that they wanted to be. Although
							the impact I had on the families was positive, I had to sacrifice
							my work-life balance to achieve it. So I used the time management
							and priority management skills that I developed by working with
							ACS on myself, and realized that a career change was in order.
						</p>
						<p>
							I completed my training in web development through Fullstack
							Academy using the PERN stack. I am a naturally curious person who
							seeks answers and solutions to complex problems. Since starting
							the program I have deepened my knowledge of things I never knew
							existed and only became more eager to see how I can implement them
							in the projects I create. In the process of learning new
							technologies like Algolia and Next.js, I love to break and test
							things throughout my debugging process. The action brought back
							memories of my studies in Neuroscience and Psychology where I
							learned that the only way to explore the unknown is to test and
							experiment.
						</p>
						<p>
							I collaborated with my team to make Optim8 - a dating app inspired
							by the difficulties faced by single mothers in the dating scene.
							We collaborated to research the needs of the target population and
							experimented with different APIs to evaluate how appropriate they
							would be for the features we wished to implement. To make my
							team's project a reality, and to ensure its matching capabilities
							are safe and fair, I delved into the abyss that was SQL and
							PLPGSQL for PostgreSQL. For others, this may just be a process and
							consequence of development. But for me, it was a moment when I
							knew that I can let go of my trauma of learning a language.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am someone who can live in the moment, however, I am always
							looking ahead to the end goal, and how to achieve it. While
							working I would keep a holistic view of how it relates to the rest
							of a project, and one step at a time, view it in the context of
							the world around me.
