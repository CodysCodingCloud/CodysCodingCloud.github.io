    "description": "Optim8 is a dating app inspired by the difficulties faced by single parents in the dating scene. Our research showed that arranged marriages are more successful in keeping people together. And for single parents, finding such stability and certainty apparent in arranged marriages would also allow them to fulfill their obligations in life and to their children without missing a beat. To simulate this, we developed a matching algorithm where bachelorettes and bachelors would be given a match once a day and allow them to immediately interact and get to know each other. By removing the ability to endlessly scroll through an endless stream of matches and immediately unlocking the ability to message their matches, the pairs would be able to pay more attention to the matches in front of them and start building a relationship."
