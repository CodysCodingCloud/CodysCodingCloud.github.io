# Portfolio Website

This website was made with a minimalistic mindset. After going through the process of learning React Next and other frameworks, I realised that it is not always necessary. By going back to vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS in this project, I was able to remind myself just how much frameworks have made things easier to build.

This site is being hosted on github pages on the custom domain: https://codyscodingcloud.com
